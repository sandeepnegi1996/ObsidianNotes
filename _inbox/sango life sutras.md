1. why you should own a house ? 
2. why you should not since people are telling do not buy house 
	1. so if people have bought a house -> they will not buy stuff like -> phone, travel , and they will not waste their money on other stuff -> so basically illuminati wants us to understand that instead of buying a house -> do a SIP and mazze kro that is what all my friends are doing no one is focusing on getting a house 
	2. getting your own house is a key -> so that now you will limit all your karche and not waste money on stuff that tou really don;t need 
3. DDA kae plat in janakpuri -> now is giving 125%
4. people think that buying a house is so tough -> 
	1. interest rate will be down soon 
	2. inflation rate sae kam rate mae agar loan mil rha hai toh meri pocket sae kuch nhi ja rha hai , we need to understand this

6. shadi nhi hogi agar ghar nhi hai 
7. ladki shaadi nhi kregi agar nhi hai 
8. financial commitment ho jayegi -> once you buy a house 
9. 20s is the best time to buy a house -> jaldi lo aur nipta do isse 
10. for me -> closest is -> Delhi NCR 
11. capital appreciation + Tax Benefits + Rental yield + dono husband wife will have this benefit

	1. bank is giving loan it will verify everything -> take a loan for repair and buy solar panels 
2. home loan -> thoda pending rakh lo 
	1. you can easily get a loan -> since you already have a loan -> it will be much easier

1. children gives lot of hapiness to kids 
2. parents ehsaan nhi kr rhe bache pr ki agar woh hume padha rahe -> parents are waking whole night if we are sick because -> they cannot sleep whole night
3. so jo parents aise palte hain ki humne itna karcha kiya hai and we want our money back -> bss phir bank ki tarah hi treat krega bacha bhi kyunki -> bank ko izzaat nhi mili 
4. my parents have told me that they have invested this much money on my education but they have never ever expected single rupee from me -> they just want me to save for my future the money that i am giving to them they have not used a single rupee on themselves same goes for priyanka parents right -> the money priyanka gave to his parents they have used 
5. so for priyanka ->she took care for her education from diploma -> took care of family as well ->+ she is also taking care of her marriage 
6. but what is her father contribution here 
7. kya parents bank hain --> so why his father is acting like that ?
8. my mom has never used my money on sisters never, ever -> i myself have given so many gifts to my sister because i can but beleive me my mom has never gave single rupee of mine to my sisters.
