### Offer Rejection Template 
```
Thank you so much for offering me the position. It has been a pleasure speaking with you and learning more about the company after I was interviewed for this post.

Unfortunately, after giving a great deal of thought to this career opportunity, I have decided that it is in my best interest, as well as the company’s, to turn down your gracious job offer which I had earlier accepted. This is because I have recently decided to accept another position that I believe is a better fit for my abilities and skill set.

I am so sorry for any inconvenience my decision may cause.

I again thank you for the opportunity and the recruitment experience I had, please extend my sincere thanks to all those who were involved in the experience.
