## Overview
- I have been in IT for the past 3 years around and now i was looking for a job change because of various reasons, This blogpost is all about how my confidence skyrocketed in the interviews


## Motivation
- So why I wanted to change my job and give interviews in the first place, that is a complete different story for that i will write one more blogpost. [[Why I resigned at my first job ?]]

## Scheduling Interviews 
- Giving interviews is a very tedious process, there are multiple ways by which you can apply to companies such as use online platform such as Naukri.com, Monster.com, Instahyre , Linkedin , or applying directly in the companies website.

## Failures in Interviews
- Initially I did not get any calls since my notice period was 90 days and It was really hard for each organization to schedule the interview, but later when the interviews started I failed almost all the interviews in the first round.

- In my previous firm where I was working , I have worked on Test Automation, Java, Springboot, Angular , API Testing, Performance Testing, Azure Devops Build pipelines.

- So my understanding was they should ask me the same thing.
- No but that is completely wrong they don't wanted to test me on the things I did rather they wanted to test me either on Java, JavaScript and basics of Framework such as SpringBoot or Angular or React and then DS, Algo , Competitive Coding.

- *I failed majorly all my interviews really bad for my confidence level and preparations*

## How I turned my failures into Wins ?

### Narrowed my interview Search
- First I narrow down my approach for the job profile to backend developer role only 
- So they will now only ask me 
	- Java, basics of Framework, DS, Algorithm , Competitive Coding.


### Document interview Questions
- I was failing most of the tech interviews but i started taking notes and then learning about all the concepts asked in the intervies
- This has helped me in two ways I have good document of interview Questions + It helped me to learn some new concepts and relearn some concepts that I already know

 *Whenever you think you knows a particular technology just give interviews and see how much you know :) *


### Prep Coding problems
- One of my friend name driviz he told me about 450-DSA Cracker this is a sheet for coding problems , that really helped me to improve my understanding i have solved some Questions from this sheet. I have also documented those and their solutions


### Take my documentation skills to next level
- During this process ,  I came acrosss *obsidian* and fell in love with this tool and the simplicity and extensibility of this tool, 
- This can be used for note taking of any type this is a really great tool do check it out


## Confidence level Improvement
- Soon when I have improved on previous steps I can see that now I was able to crack few interviews and cracked first and second rounds of few firms
- This reassured that I was on a right track
- I kept following all the points in previous steps and soon I was holding around 8 Offers .
