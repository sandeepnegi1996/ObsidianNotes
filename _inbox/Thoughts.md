5. my mom is feeling lonely at home : so basically she is feeling lonely and no is around her  
possible reasons :  
1. all of her kids were not in the town and mostly they will come like 2-3 months in a year  
2. earlier we were living in roorkee and there were lot of relatives and other people whom my mother and father knew for the past 35 years of their life and for my father that is close to 50 years , basically 2/3rd of his life he has spent there only and rishikesh is kind of new for them it is getting hard for them to actually digest and at this age it is actually difficult to make friends  
  
3. moreover my mom and dad is not having a job right now and they are feeling bored too.
