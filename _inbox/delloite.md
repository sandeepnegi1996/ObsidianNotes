### Offer rejection template 

```

Thank you so much for offering me the position. It has been a pleasure speaking with you and learning more about the company after I was interviewed for this post.

Unfortunately, after giving a great deal of thought to this career opportunity, I have decided that it is in my best interest, as well as the companyâ€™s, to turn down your gracious job offer which I had earlier accepted. This is because I have recently decided to accept another position that I believe is a better fit for my abilities and skill set.

I am so sorry for any inconvenience my decision may cause.

I again thank you for the opportunity and the recruitment experience I had, please extend my sincere thanks to all those who were involved in the experience.****

 1. since i have good experinence on technical as well as client handling , I have really helped many projects, so i think i will also be able add the same value to deloitte .Since some of my friends and relative are working in deloitte and they always talks about the workcultutre and good experience, so I am more inclined towards deloite rather than other offers. and i wanted to work for deloitte for a longer time , for this to happen, i need to make sure my compensatiion is competetive :)
 . i was expecting around 13LPA fixed from deloitte 

- can we make it somewhat closer to 13 LPA so that it will really good for me, i can really stop giving more interviews 
- 

- no it is not possible

- can we do it like adding the variable to the fix component and making bonus to be 1L so that i will easier for me to relocate to gurgaon

- no it is not possible

OK, no problem then ok final like , can we make bonus to be 1L so that it will be easier to relocate to the location.
