Hello Chandana,

I hope you're having a wonderful day!

I wanted to express my appreciation for our collaboration. I'm currently updating my LinkedIn profile to accurately reflect my skills and experiences. In light of this, I'd be grateful if you could provide a LinkedIn recommendation based on our recent project and any skills you've observed in me.

I'm also willing to reciprocate by writing a recommendation for you. Please let me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to highlight.

Are you comfortable writing a recommendation for me? If not, that's completely fine, and there's no pressure either way.

Best regards,

Sandeep Singh Negi
