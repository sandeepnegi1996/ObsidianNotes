*Just Perform 1% better then Yesterday*
 
 *Focus Mode and Pomodoro and TimeBlocking* 

 *Never Reveal, until you finish something *
 
*Train your brain to do hard things *

*Never Ever Ask anyone for money*

*You were born poor that is fine, but you die poor that is not fine*

*Never Attach yourself to the things, people and emotions around you just live in that moment and then move on*

*Try to live as much minimal as possible since then only you will not attach yourself to stuff near you*

**Be aware what you share with your colleagues since that can be devastating to your career**

**Keep your personal feelings aside from your day job **

*Share personal stuff only with your loved ones *
