## Key Takeaways

### Points 
1. ML is application of AI
2. learn from experience rather than explicitly programming.
3. ML , computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.


4.  we give trainning data or knowledge graphs so that machine can understnad
5. it looks for patern in the data so to later make inferences
6. Primary Aim : ML to allow programs to learn on its own from the accessed data

7. Coined by `Arthur Samuel` 
8. With huge computing power : machines can identify `pattern` , `relationship` between input data and with this we can automate some routine processes
9. AI is the goal for Machine learning
10. Application : chatbots, self-driving cars and speech regonition, facial recognition

Personal : i the past i have made one program to match the face that can basically match the face of the individual with the percentage, this can be used for the facial recognition

### Adavantages
1. DataSecurity : find the risk or vulnerabilituies 
2. Finance : Chatbots is used by banks or any other companies, fintech is using ML models to get the information on the trades
3. Healthcare : somewhere i read , it was able to find the cancer before doctors could even find
4. Fraud Detection
5. Retail : for suggestions of the product


###  Trainning Methods
1. Supervised : information is labelled
2. Unsupervised : information is not labelled
3. Semi-Supervised  :
7.
