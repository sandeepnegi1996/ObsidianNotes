#### Tips to buy an insurance :) 
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggc0sybgwZI&t=308s&ab_channel=WealthDekho
	1.  Car insurance contains two things 
		1. Third Party Damage -> that is almost same from each vendor and this is mandatory
			1. made mandatory by goverment 
			2. if you have hit someone usko recover kregi -> apka damage woh bhi cover hoga 
			3. set by government 
		2. Vehicle Own Damage
			1. comprehensive insurance 
				1. value of car -> IDV value -> https://idv.gicouncil.in/ -> use this to calculate IDV value 
				2. insurance company will pay the IDV value -> incase of theft and car is lost in flood.
			2. NCB Discount 
				1. if no claim is done -> we will get NCB discount 
				2. do not claim for small cases -> we can increase the NCB discount 
			3. Zero Depreciation
