## 10 mistakes java developer makes 
1. we cannot remove the elements from the array list when we are traversing it for that we need to use Iterator 
2. 

#### BDD in java 
1. First a user story will be created based on the customer requirement 
2. 3 Amigos meeting -> Product Owner , Developer, Tester
	1. They will discuss all the possible scenarios that can take place in this user story and that are imp to be considered ,and what areas they can affect.
3. Discovery phase is completed with the above scenarios
4. ![[Pasted image 20240924232920.png]]
5. Formulation 
	1. ![[Pasted image 20240924233322.png]]
	2. 
#### Maven and its life cycle 
1. project management model 
2. it uses pom.xml -> project object model to have all the confirgurations 
3. build generation 
4. dependency resolution 
5. documentation 
6. every pom is child of some pom
7. super pom is the parent of all the pom.xml 
8. `<parent>` is having a pom.xml all the dependenceies will come to the child 
9. artifactId is the unique identifier of the project 
10. `properties` is the key value pair for configuration -> we can re use it in the anywhere in the pom.xml
11. repositories -> repositor from which you wanted to pull the depdendenceis like nexus or other internal repository or maven global repository 
12. Lets understand Build Life Cycle 
	1.  ![[Pasted image 20240916155933.png]]
13. when we only wants to package it will also run all the previous phases 
14. Each phase will have multiple goals 
15. with the help of build we can add more goals in a particualr phase in hte pom.xml
16. ![[Pasted image 20240916160900.png]]
17. so in above code we are adding goal check in the validate phase so all the goals of validate should work before this goal check
18. check what plugins we can add in the validate phase to enforce a check stle 
19. `mvn validate`
20. `mvn compile`
21.  `mvn test`
22. `mvn package `
23. `mvn verify`
24. static code analysis we can do in the verify phase
	1. ![[Pasted image 20240916163244.png]]
25. `mvn insall ` -> to install the package in the local repository 
26.  with mvn deploy -> it will all the previous phases and it will also deploy to remote repository which is present.
27. for this need to configure the distribution management in pom.xml for the remote repository and also we need to configure server in the settings.xml with the repository and the credentials details 

![[Pasted image 20240917161237.png]]





### Springboot Best Practices 
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT8dbbe783s
2. Leaking internals  
3. Not using records 
4. Dependency Injection correctly ->  
	1. constructor injection is better than setter injection
5. Separation of Concerns 
	1. we should strictly follow separation of concerns 
6. create default exception handler in springboot 
7. not using annotaiton validations 

#### 14 years interview experience 
1. how you are working as a team -> we do peer to peer code review 
2. solid principles. 
3. so best is to log all the best practices at one place which can be followed by everyone 
4. if there a deadline , and you need to deliver on time. 
5. created a several task -> and then deliver it -> divide the story into smaller story 







#### @Transactional Annotattion Part 1 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf-gAW8hGQA&list=PL6W8uoQQ2c60g6_fcjDCLHSx1LBeVYqyZ&index=14&ab_channel=Concept%26%26Coding-byShrayansh

1. Critical Secton -> code segment -> where shared resources are accessed and modified.
2. lets say a piece of code is updating something in database 
3. and multiple requests are there and trying to update these resource.lets say book a cab or update database 
4. data in consistency can come here -> @Transactional is there to rescue us
5. @Transactional will follow ACID properties 
6. ACID -> 
7. example taking money out of A and putting in B -> A debit and B Credit
8. Isolation -> locking is done by @Transactional annotaion,
9. Durability -> data is persisted 
10. ![[Pasted image 20240716214859.png]]
11. spring will look for @Transactional and then Transactional interceptor will kick in and the @Around aspect will be ran -> it will begin transactions run the busincess logic and if there is no error s commit the transaction and if there is any error it will rollback the transactions,

11. Declarative approach 
12. how to send your own transaction manager to @Transactional annotation
13. Create a bean of Transaction Manager amd them pass teh same in the @Transactional
14. 
![[Pasted image 20240717120234.png]]

14. When to you programmtic approach 

![[Pasted image 20240717120708.png]]

15. ![[Pasted image 20240717121540.png]]

#### Propogation Transaction 
1. Required -> is the default propogration -> 
	1. if parent parent is present use that one do not create new transaction n
2. REQUIRED_NEW 
	1. so basically it will create a new transaction it will not use the existing transaction 
	2. ![[Pasted image 20240717122409.png]]

3. 
### Important Points 
- Clean Code Principles
	1. DRY
	2. Never Nester 
		1. Extraction 
			1. Single Responsibility 
		2. Inversion -> Failing Fast and Early 
	3. Failing Fast and Early 
	


#### Clean Code java 

Naming Things in Code 
1. two hard things in computer science caching validation and naming conventions 
2. 

3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFRhGnuXG-4&ab_channel=CodeAesthetic
4. Never Nester
5. linus trovalds is never nester 
6. never nester will not nest their cod e
7. never tester -> can handle -> 3 deep maximum means 3 curly braces 
8. Extraction and Inversion -> we extract some code or we do some inversion 
	1. without inversion we are just following happy path -> so we will invert that 
	2. in inversion -> all the validation will be done first and then the actual method will be used 
	3. so after moving all the checks and validation to the start of the function -> we can happily focus on the crux of the code 
9. We Can apply both at the same time 
10. 


11. I wanted to learn clean code techniques since it can definitely improve my coding knowledge and understanding 
12. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSDyiEjhp8k&ab_channel=ConnerArdman
13. Fixing nesting 
	1. ![[Pasted image 20240611194100.png]]

	1. solution for the above code is 
	2. ![[Pasted image 20240611194344.png]]
	3. Ambiguity in code  
		1. is -> infront of function tell us that that method will return the boolean value 
		2. ![[Pasted image 20240611194610.png]]
		3. Solution  -> we have changed the variable name and we have changed the method name -> isPasswordLongEnough this tell us that if the password is long enough or not 
			1. ![[Pasted image 20240611194623.png]]
		4. overcommenting -> since the comment get stale so do not add the comments 
			1. only add comments for the most important part. complicated logic 
		5. Consistent Formatting
			1. use the code editor indentation always 
		6. DRY -> Don't Repeat yourself 
			1. do not repeat the business logic 
			2. find the code that is repeated at many places and then may be create some function that can be used repeately 
		7. Failing Fast and Early -> This is important
			1. Error conditions should be checked first 
		8. Magic Values 
			1. hardcoded string 
		9. SingleReponsibility Principle 
			1. pure function -> a function should do one thing 
		10. Pre mature optimization 


#### How Senior Programmers Actually Write Code 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfMBROEO0&ab_channel=ThrivingTechnologist
1. Senior Developer write code  that is  more  readable code.
2. habits for the senior developer 
3. **Prevent unfinished work** -> have the pride -> this is how senior programmer
4. **Enforce Coding Standards** ->  in the team -> use the open source coding standards
5. **Document Chosen Patterns** -> patterns sh
6. Document the decisions you have made in a projects 
7. Never Expose Refactoring -> this will make you look noob
	1. but better is incremental refactoring 
8. How to Estimate Work -> estimate -> documentation -> and some issue -> testing

2. [ ] `Predicate<FileStatus> IS_FILE_TYPE = fileStatus -> fileStatus !=null `
3. [ ] @Transactional
4. [ ] custom Exception -> `new ESGException`
5. [ ] HttpsUrlConnection -> `setInstanceFollowRedirects` false

5. What is IOC Container ?
6. What is Dependency Injection ?
7. what is application context and its use 
8. what is the difference between spring filter and spring interceptors. 
9. ## Why to use @Transactional annotation what's the benefit?(In spring interview @Transactional annotation is always asked)
10. what is the difference between hashtable and concurrent hashmap?
11. - **Hashtable:** Uses a single lock for the entire table. This means only one thread can access the table at a time, even for reads, creating a bottleneck in high-concurrency scenarios.
- **ConcurrentHashMap:** Uses fine-grained locking at the bucket level (segments). This allows concurrent reads and limited concurrent writes, significantly improving performance in multi-threaded environments.
12. What is the use of StringTokenizer ?
13. what is SpringSecurity Context ?
14. ## Between these two who will consume more memory(int or Integer)?
15. ## What is the difference between these interfaces- Predicates,Supplier,Consumer and Function?
	1. [https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-functional-interface](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-functional-interfaces)
16. ## Difference between Callable and Runnable?
17. How you will optimize a database Query ?
	1. https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-trends/data-modeling/optimizing-sql-queries
	2. what is database indexing ?
	3. how it will benefit you 
	4. how to choose which column we need to do the indexing on 
	5. In perfect world, you'd like to index columns, that appear in `WHERE` clause or `JOIN` condition. In your case it would be `Email` and `Password` columns.
	6. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31206799/how-to-choose-columns-when-creating-index
19. what is sharding in database ?
20. ## Difference Hibernate First Level and Second Level Caching?

Hibernate offers two levels of caching to improve application performance by reducing database calls: First-Level Cache and Second-Level Cache. Here’s a breakdown of their key differences:

**Scope**

- **First-Level Cache (L1 Cache):** Session-specific. Exists for the duration of a single Hibernate session. Data loaded by one query within a session is available to subsequent queries within the same session without hitting the database again.
- **Second-Level Cache (L2 Cache):** Optional, application-wide cache. Shared across all Hibernate sessions associated with the same session factory. Data loaded by one session can be reused by other sessions, significantly reducing database interactions.

20. Difference Get and Load in hibernate?

**Data Fetching Strategy:**

- **get:** Performs an immediate database query to fetch the object identified by the ID.
- If the object exists in the database, it’s returned as a fully populated object.
- If the object doesn’t exist, `get` returns `null`.
- **load:** Returns a proxy object representing the identified entity.
- The actual data from the database is retrieved only when you access a property or method of the object. This technique is called Lazy Loading.
- If the object doesn’t exist in the database, `load` throws an `ObjectNotFoundException` when you try to access its properties.

21. ## Difference Save and Persist in hibernate?

**save:**

- Tries to insert a new record into the database.
- If the object already has an identifier (primary key) assigned, it assumes an update operation and performs an update query.
- Returns the generated identifier (if applicable).

**persist:**

- Marks the object as managed by Hibernate for persistence.
- The actual insert operation happens when the transaction is committed, not necessarily immediately.
- Does not return anything (void).


22. group the students by department name  ->so we have student class with student details and department name 

```java
Map<String, List<Student>> mapData = list.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Student::getDepartmantName));  
System.out.println("Students grouped by the department names : "+mapData);

```

23. find the max age of the student 

```java
OptionalInt maxAge = list.stream().mapToInt(dt -> dt.getAge()).max();  
System.out.println("Max age of student : "+maxAge.getAsInt());
```

24. count of student in each department 
```java
Map<String, Long> countStudentInEachdept = list.stream()  
.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Student::getDepartmantName, Collectors.counting()));  
System.out.println("Student count in each department : "+countStudentInEachdept);

```

25. check his design knowledge on creating an ingestion service where we need to take a big file and need to send it to external vendor

26. Database -> student table and advisor table https://www.deskbright.com/sql/sql-joins-interview-questions/

Simply put, `INNER JOIN` should be used when we want to _exclude all records_ that do not match both of the tables we're joining.

-> this will give us all the student name and adivsor name where advisor in not null
```sql
SELECT s.first_name AS student_name, a.first_name AS advisor_name
FROM students AS s
INNER JOIN advisors AS a ON s.advisor_id = a.advisor_id;
```


-> Left Join ->Notice that our data set now contains information on _all_ students, even those for whom the advisor is set to `NULL`!
```sql
SELECT s.first_name AS student_name, a.first_name AS advisor_name
FROM students AS s
LEFT JOIN advisors AS a ON s.advisor_id = a.advisor_id;
```

### Cisco Interview Questions ?
30. What is Spring  Bean Life Cycle ?
	1. Spring IoC Container is responsible for instantiating , initializing and wiring beans, container manages the life cycle of a bean.
	2. Spring provides several ways to tap into bean lifecycle , Ex once bean is instantiated, you might want to perform something to get bean into usable state or you might want to clean up resources before bean is removed from the container.
	3. How to create custom init and destroy method in spring 
		- here we have simmle class and it has normal method customDestroy() and customInit() 
		- we will define our bean using the xml configuration and wire these methods with the `init-method` and `destroy-method`
		- init-method will be called when spring initializes the bean properties using setter or constructor 
		- we cna use this to validate the properties or perform some task
		- destroy method is called before we destroy the bean
		- 
		```java
		package guru.springframework.springbeanlifecycle.custominitanddestroy.domain;
		public class BookCustomBean {
		
		private String bookName;
		
		public BookCustomBean() {
		
		System.out.println("Constructor of BookCustomBean bean is called !! ");
		}
		public void customDestroy() throws Exception {
		System.out.println("Custom destroy method of BookCustomBean called !! ");
		}
		public void customInit() throws Exception {
		System.out.println("Custom Init method of BookCustomBean called !! ");
		}
		public BookCustomBean(String bookName) {
		this.bookName = bookName;
		}
		public String getBookName() {
		return bookName;
		}
		public void setBookName(String bookName) {
		this.bookName = bookName;
		}
		@Override
		public String toString() {
		return "Book{" +
		"bookName='" + bookName + '\'' +
		'}';
		}
		}
		```
		
		
		```xml
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

#### Java Concepts from Solution

1. **[ ] 14. checkout this Software Architecture Guide https://martinfowler.com/architecture/**
	1. Architecture 
		1. Architecutre is about important stuff whatever it is .
		2. so if we are building an application what is the most important thing in that application.
		3. 



3. **Tell Don't Ask**
	1. object oriented programming is all about bundling the data and functions together.
	2. Instead of asking object for data and then acting on the data -> we should tell an object what do to

![[Pasted image 20240514162335.png]]

- Ask Example 
```java

AskMonitor am = new AskMonitor("Time Vortex Hocus", 2, alarm);
am.setValue(3);
if (am.getValue() > am.getLimit()) 
  am.getAlarm().warn(am.getName() + " too high")

```

- Tell Example  -> here when we are setting the value there it self we are doing the actual work
```java
class TellMonitor...

  public void setValue(int arg) {
    value = arg;
    if (value > limit) alarm.warn(name + " too high");
  }
```

- data and behavior should be tightly coupled -> 

1. @Service
	1.  To detect the beans automatically Spring uses classpath scanning annotations.
	2.  spring uses scanning to search for all the beans in the project using annotations and then register each bean in the application context.
	3. @Component -> means this bean is spring managed. , this can be applied on any class to make the beans as Spring Managed Beans 
		1. @Service and @Repository are basically more special cases of component.
		2. @Service service layer ->it is same as @Component means spring managed beans -> but it holds business logic.
		3. @Repository -> persistance layer which will act as a database repository.


2. @RequiredArgsConstructor
	1. this annotation belongs to project lombok and it will create constructor for us for 
		1. private final fields 
		2. non null fields


```java
public class ClassWithFinalNonNullMembers {

    private final String finalStringObject;
    @NonNull
    private String nonNullStringObject;

    private String nonFinalStringObject;

    // standard getters
}

### 3. Curl
- with curl we can make a http call to any endpoint , and we can use this to verify the connection also
- we can mention proxy information so you are working in a corporate environment this can be used to test the connection 
- -x --> proxy
- --request POST
- -- url
- --header
- -- data 

```curl

curl -x proxy:80 --request POST \
--url endpoint
--header 'Authorization: Basic authorizationtoken \ 
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '["data1", "data2"]'
```

### Understanding how streaming works in java 
First, You should understand "streaming" in Java because all "Readers" in Java are built upon this concept.

**File Streaming**

File streaming is carried out by the _FileInputStream_ object in Java.

```java
// it reads a byte at a time and stores into the 'byt' variable
int byt;
while((byt = fileInputStream.read()) != -1) {
    fileOutputStream.write(byt);
} 
```

This object reads a byte(8-bits) at a time and writes it to the given file.

A practical useful application of it would be to work with raw binary/data files, such as images or audio files (use AudioInputStream instead of FileInputStream for audio files). On the other hand, it is very inconvenient and slower for text files, because of looping through a byte at a time, then do some processing and store the processed byte back is tedious and time-consuming.

You also need to provide the character set of the text file, i.e if the characters are in _Latin_ or _Chinese_, etc. Otherwise, the program would decode and encode 8-bits at a time and you'd see weird chars printed on the screen or written in the output file (if a char is more than 1 byte long, i.e. non-ASCII characters).

**File Reading**

This is just a fancy way of saying "File streaming" with inclusive charset support (i.e no need to define the charset, like earlier).

The _FileReader_ class is specifically designed to deal with the text files. As you've seen earlier, the file streaming is best to deal with raw binary data, but for the sake of text, it is not so efficient.

So the Java-dudes added the _FileReader_ class, to deal specifically with the text files. It reads 2 bytes (or 4 bytes, depends on the charset) at a time. A remarkably huge improvement over the preceding _FileInputStream_!!

so the streaming operation is like this,

```java
int c;
while ( (c = fileReader.read()) != -1) { // some logic }
```

Please note, Both classes use an integer variable to store the value retrieved from the input file (so every char is converted into an integer while fetching and back to the char while storing).

The only advantage here is that this class deals only with text files, so you don't have to specify the charset and a few other properties. It provides an out-of-the-box solution, for most of the text files processing cases. It also supports internationalization and localization.

But again it's still very slow (Imaging reading 2 bytes at a time and looping through it!).

**Buffering streams**

To tackle the problem of continuous looping over a byte or 2. The Java-dudes added another spectacular functionality. **"To create a buffer of data, before processing."**

The concept is pretty much alike when a user streams a video on YouTube. A video is buffered before playing, to provide flawless video watching experience. (Tho, the browser keeps buffering until the whole video is buffered ahead of time.) The same technique is used by the _BufferedReader_ class.

A _BufferedReader_ object takes a _FileReader_ object as an input which contains all the necessary information about the text file that needs to be read. (such as the file path and charset.)

```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader( new FileReader("example.txt") );
```

When the "read" instruction is given to the _BufferedReader_ object, it uses the _FileReader_ object to read the data from the file. When an instruction is given, the _FileReader_ object reads 2 (or 4) bytes at a time and returns the data to the _BufferedReader_ and the reader keeps doing that until it hits '\n' or '\r\n' (The end of the line symbol). Once a line is buffered, the reader waits patiently, until the instruction to buffer the next line is given.

Meanwhile, The _BufferReader_ object creates a special memory place (On the RAM), called "Buffer", and stores all the fetched data from the _FileReader_ object.

```java
// this variable points to the buffered line
String line;

// Keep buffering the lines and print it.
while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
    printWriter.println(line);
}
```

Now here, instead of reading 2 bytes at a time, a whole line is fetched and stored in the RAM somewhere, and when you are done with processing the data, you can store the whole line back to the hard disk. So it makes the process run way faster than doing 2 bytes a time.

But again, why do we need to pass FileReader object to the BufferReader? Can't we just say "buffer this file" and the BufferReader would take care of the rest? wouldn't that be sweet?

Well, the _BufferReader_ class is created in a way that it only knows how to create a buffer and to store incoming data. It is irrelevant to the object from where the data is coming. So the same object can be used for many other input streams than just text files.

So being said that, When you provide the FileReader object as an input, it buffers the file, the same way if you provide the _InputStreamReader_ as an object, it buffers the Terminal/Console input data until it hits a newline symbol. such as,

```java
// Object that reads console inputs
InputStreamReader console = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(console);
System.out.println(br.readLine());
```

This way, you can read (or buffer) multiple streams with the same _BufferReader_ class, such as text files, consoles, printers, networking data etc, and all you have to remember is,

```java
 bufferedReader.readLine();
```

to print whatever you've buffered.
### 1. Simple java program to read from files using FileReader

- reading from a file using FileReader 

```java
File file=null;  
FileReader fileReader=null;  
StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder();  
try {  
     file = new File("src/main/java/com/vksviit/patterns/factorydesignpattern/streaming/sample.txt");  
    fileReader = new FileReader(file);  
    int currentChar=0;  
  
    while(  (currentChar=fileReader.read())!=-1) {  
            char ch = (char)currentChar;  
            sb.append(ch);  
  
    }  
  
    System.out.println(sb);  
  
}catch (IOException e) {  
    e.printStackTrace();  
} finally {  
  
    if (fileReader!=null) {  
        fileReader.close();  
    }  
}
```
### 2. Simple java program to read from files using BufferedReader 

```java
try {  
    System.out.println("reading from sameple 3 ");  
    bufferedReader = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader( new FileInputStream(("src/main/java/com/vksviit/patterns/factorydesignpattern/streaming/sample3.txt"))) );  
    String currentLine;  
    while(  (currentLine =bufferedReader.readLine())!=null) {  
        System.out.println(currentLine);  
    }  
  
}catch (IOException e) {  
    e.printStackTrace();  
  
} finally {  
  
    if(bufferedReader!=null) {  
        bufferedReader.close();  
    }  
}  
  
  
System.out.println("reading from BufferedReader Ended ...");
```


### 3. Read from a file and write to another file using BufferedReader and BufferedWriter

```java
  
try (BufferedReader reader4 = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("src/main/java/com/vksviit/patterns/factorydesignpattern/streaming/sample4.txt")), 16384);  
     BufferedWriter writer4 = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream("src/main/java/com/vksviit/patterns/factorydesignpattern/streaming/sample5.txt")), 16384)) {  
  
    String currentLine;  
    while ((currentLine = reader4.readLine()) != null) {  
        System.out.println(currentLine);  
        writer4.write(currentLine);  
        writer4.write("\n");  
    }  
  
  
} catch (Exception e) {  
    e.printStackTrace();  
  
}
```



### 4. Read from a file and create chunks of size 1000 and store it in the disk

BufferedWriter bufferedWriter2 = null;  
  
try{  
  
    bufferedReader2= new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("src/main/java/com/vksviit/patterns/factorydesignpattern/streaming/sample6.txt"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8));  
  
    String currentString;  
    int count=0;  
    while ((currentString = bufferedReader2.readLine())!=null) {  
  
        if (count++ %10==0) {  
            //create new file  
           if (bufferedWriter2!=null) {  
               bufferedWriter2.close();  
           }  
  
            System.out.println("count is  :  " +count);

            System.out.println("chunk name is :   "+ "smallChunk" +(count/10));  
        }  
        bufferedWriter2.write(currentString);
