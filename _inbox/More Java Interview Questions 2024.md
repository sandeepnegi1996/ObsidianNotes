How to delete middle element of linkedin list  
can we overload and override the static method  
can we use equals method in java for double comparison d1 and d2  
1. Delete a node from a linkedin list implement a linked list from scratch  
2. what is the use of immutable class and how to implement a immutable class  
3. what is threadpool in java simple example to show a thread pool and using it  
5. Difference between @Controller and @RestController  
6. what is @Configuration and @Component and when to use when  
7. what if there are two beans of same name and we are injecting  
8. Department with maximum salary ?  
can we use custom object as a key in java

1. How to choose the thread pool ?  
a. Thread pool is a collection of thread that is managed by thread pool manager ,  
b. When a tasks is submitted to thread pool, it assign the task to the available thread from the pool.  
a. Single thread pool -> there will be single thread in this case that will be use  
b. newFixedThreadPool -> it has fixed number of threads once the pool is initialized , and when the pool is shutdown then only threads  
are removed , and if a new task is submitted  
c. CachedThreadPool -> it can create threads on the go, as required  
2. What is the difference between execute and submit ?  
a. Execute method will accept runnable  
a. It will not return anything  
b. Submit : accpets both so if we are passing callable -> submit can return the future  
c.  
3. Why thread creation is expensive in Java ?  
• A large block of memory has to be allocated and initialized for the thread stack. -> since each thread has its own stack it is expensive to create thread  
• System calls need to be made to create / register the native thread with the host OS.  
• Descriptors need to be created, initialized and added to JVM-internal data structures.  
  
- Sometimes using the same thread to complete a task is much more effificient rather than creating a new thread.  
- Also try using thread pool rather than thread for each task -> since thread pool -> threads are initialized once and then being used once needed

1. What is project Loom ?  
2. How multithreading will work with single core ?  
a. We can use multiple threads in a single core but the problem is at a time only a single thread will execute and then there is a context switching or thread switching between  
b. Threads and this is very fast so to the end user it will appear like they are running in parallel but in reality a single thread is running at a time.  
c. So lets say there is a process and that process has 4 threads and the number of processor is also 4 in that case we will be sure that it will run in multiprocessor.  
  
3. How to write a junit testcase ?  
4. Differnece between synchronized block and synchronized method level and block  
  
5. Questions on joins and learn more about database ?  
  
6. Print something in java without using main method ?  
a. we can achieve this using a static block and empty main method  
  
*/  
public class test89 {  
static {  
System.out.println("first ");  
}  
static {  
System.out.println("second ");  
}  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
System.out.println("inside main");  
}  
  
  
  
}  
  
  
Output :  
  
  
7. What will happen if we have a class without a main method ?  
a. It will compile but it will not run  
b. Since main method is required by the JVM  
8. What will happen if we remove the static keyword from the main method ?  
a. In that case code will compile but will not run since jvm will look only for a specific method with specific signature  
b. And the runtime error that we will receive is  
  
  
a.  
  
1. What are the different containers in spring ?  
a. Application Context and Bean Factory are two different containers in Spring.  
b. Application context extends bean factory  
c. Bean Factory  
a. Bean instantiation/wiring  
d. Application Context  
a. Bean instantiation/wiring,  
b. Automatic BeanPostProcessor registration  
c. Automatic BeanFactoryPostProcessor registration  
d. Convenient MessageSource access (for i18n)  
e. ApplicationEvent publication  
e. So depending on our needs we can decide which container we wanted to use  
f.  
g. There are several implementation of Application Context  
a. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext : if we have xml file with the bean definition then, we can use this to create a container with  
b. all the beans defined in the container  
  
h. Examples  
a. Using ClassPathXmlApplicationContext -> to get the bean  
  
  
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");  
HelloWorld obj = (HelloWorld) context.getBean("helloWorld");  
  
2. What is Spring Bean  
a. A java object which is managed by the spring container :)  
b. Example  
a. Simple hello world class  
  
package net.javaguides.spring.ioc;  
public class HelloWorld {  
private String message;  
public void setMessage(String message) {  
this.message = message;  
}  
public void getMessage() {  
System.out.println("My Message : " + message);  
}  
}  
  
  
  
Simple xml file for the container is :)  
  
  
<?xml version= "1.0" encoding= "UTF-8"?>  
<beansxmlns="[http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans](http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans)"xmlns:xsi="[http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance)"xsi:schemaLocation="[http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans](http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans) [http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd](http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd)">  
  
<beanid = "helloWorld"class="net.javaguides.spring.ioc.HelloWorld">  
<property name="message" value="Hello World!"/>  
</bean>  
</beans>  
  
  
  
  
  
-  
  
  
  
3. What is @Dialect ?  
a. So in spring we need to set the dialect for each db -> in the [application.properties](http://application.properties/) file -> lets say we are using mysql8  
  
- spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect  
  
- Now if we wanted to move to amazon implmentation of mysqldb -> we need to again go ahead and change this dialect settings.  
- From hibernate 6 there is an automatic dialect resolution -> which can fetch database meta data -> so it will have database version and and JDBC client version  
- And from the  
With the DialectResolutionInfo in place, Hibernate can pick up the proper Dialect and configure its behavior based on the underlying database server and client capabilities.  
  
  
  
  
1. Simple example of rest full controller in springboot ?  
  
@RestController  
@RequestMapping("/api/v1")  
class ProductController {  
  
@Autowired  
ProductService productService;  
  
@GetMapping("/products")  
public List<Product> getProducts( ) {  
  
return productService.getAllProducts();  
  
}  
  
  
@GetMapping("/product/{id}")  
public ResponseEntity<Product> getProductById(@PathVariable int id) {  
  
Product product = productService.getProductById(id);  
  
if(product!=null)  
return ResponseEntity.ok(product);  
else  
ResponseEntity.notFound().build();  
  
  
  
}  
@PutMapping("/product/{productId}")  
public Product updateProduct(@PathVariable int productId, @RequestBody Product product) {  
  
return productService.updateProduct(id,product);  
  
}  
  
  
  
  
  
//get Mapping for a single product  
}  
  
2. What is idempotency in spring with put request ?  
a. With the same set of inputs the systems should give same outputs , means the system should be consistent  
b. The outcome or results should not change with calling it multiple times.  
c. Http methods can be idempotent or non-idempotent.  
i. GET -> idempotent -> since only read operation  
ii. PUT - > idempotent -> lets say we have merchant data and then we are chaning account for this mid -> and then we are again fetching  
1) Results it should return the same results.  
iii. Delete : idempotent -> means if we are deleting the same records multiple times , it will produce same results the system state will be same.  
iv. POST : non idempotent -> since it will change the systems state it will create new data  
  
- We can make put request idempotent  
○ Calling the endpoint we will first check where that particular id exist  
  
  
1. Order annotation for spring boot ?  
a. @Component@Order(-1)publicclassA{ }  
b. @Component@Order(5)publicclassD{ }  
c. @Component@Order(-24)publicclassC{ }  
d. @Component@Order(5)publicclassB{ }  
  
- @Order Annotation specifies the order of loading the bean by spring container. The lower the order(integer), higher is the precedence.  
So order of 0 will have more precedence than order of 10. Likewise order of -100 will have more precedence than 0.  
  
  
  
1. Volatile Keyword -> use and real time examples ?  
a. volatile keyword makes sure -> any thread that is reading a value will get the latest value of the variable  
b. In Java synchronization is possible with -> synchronized , volatile and locks  
c. But we cannot use synchronized with variable so for that matter there is a volatile keyword  
d. If the variable is not shared with multiple threads there is no need to use volatile keyword  
e. Example of creating a singleton syncrhoinzed class  
i. Make the instance variable as volatile  
ii. And synchronized the block where we are creating an instance  
  
class Singleton {  
private static volatile Singleton _instance; // volatile variable  
public static Singleton getInstance() {  
if (_instance == null) {  
synchronized (Singleton.class) {  
if (_instance == null)  
_instance = new Singleton();  
}  
}  
return _instance;  
}  
}  
  
  
- If a instance variable is marked as transient means that field will not be part of serialization.  
- Serialization is the process of converting a field into byte stream and then storing that field in database or in a file.  
- Serialization and deserialization is required since http rest services are  
2. Does final and static fields will get serialized ?  
a. Final field : yes it will be serialized -> once deserialized it will have the values which were stored during serialization.  
b. Static fields : no , it will not be serialized since static fields belongs to the class and hence once deserialized static fields will have the current value  
  
  
3. What are Custom Exception ? What is the need of Custom Exception and Examples and what are the rules of exceptions ?  
a. Usually java provides all the exception handling but in some cases for a particular workflow or bussiness logic may be wanted to provide our own exception like merchant id is not valid, parent merchant id is not valid -> these are like custom Exception that we wanted to throw  
b. Or we wanted to give more details about he existing exception class provided by java  
  
- Below mentioned code is going to throw an exception if the file is not there also if file name is incorrect in the code , we so here we don’t know whether file is not there or filename is incorrect  
  
Example of custom Checked Exception  
  
import java.io.File;  
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;  
import java.util.Scanner;  
public class Main8 {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
try (Scanner file = new Scanner(new File("test2.txt"))) {  
while (file.hasNextLine()) {  
System.out.println(file.nextLine());  
  
}  
  
}catch (FileNotFoundException e) {  
e.printStackTrace();  
  
}  
}  
}  
  
  
- Now lets see how we cab throw a custom exception if the file name is not correct  
- Create your own exception class -> extends Exception class and add the constructor  
- In the main method -> if FileNotFoundException -> inside that there will be one method to check the fileName is correct or not -> if it is not correct we will throw an exception  
- In the below mentioned exceample we are also passing throwable so that we can also print the root cause of the exception ->like from where it was originated.  
- To print the cause of the exception we need to pass the Throwable  
- Throwable -> Exception ->CustomExeption  
  
Example of custom Checked Exception  
  
import java.io.File;  
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;  
import java.util.Scanner;  
public class Main8 {  
public static void main(String[] args) throws IncorrectFileNameException {  
String fileName="test3.txt";  
try (Scanner file = new Scanner(new File(fileName))) {  
while (file.hasNextLine()) {  
System.out.println(file.nextLine());  
  
}  
  
}catch (FileNotFoundException e) {  
if(!isFileNameCorrect(fileName)) {  
throw new IncorrectFileNameException("correct filename is not being passed : "+ fileName,e);  
  
}  
  
}  
}  
private static boolean isFileNameCorrect(String fileName) {  
return false;  
}  
}  
class IncorrectFileNameException extends Exception {  
IncorrectFileNameException(String errorMessage,Throwable err) {  
super(errorMessage,err);  
}  
}  
  
  
Example of unchecked exception  
1. This exception will come at runtime  
2. For this we need to extends the RunTime Exception class  
3. Lets say we are checking the name during compile but extension we will check at runTime  
  
Whole implementation is same only  
  
public class IncorrectFileExtensionException extends RuntimeException {  
public IncorrectFileExtensionException(String errorMessage, Throwable err) {  
super(errorMessage, err);  
}  
}  
  
  
  
1. Difference between abstract and interface class in java ?  
a. What is the need of abstract class -  
i. It can be used to create a common utility class that can be used by the child classes and every child class can use the common fields and behavior mentioned in the abstract class -> child class can give their own implementation of the methods + they can also add new methods  
ii. We cannot create object of the abstract class  
b. What is the need of interface ?  
i. It is more like a contract -> and we will just declarae the methods that should be there -> and all the class which will implement it they will add their own implementation of those methods  
ii. Intercace is basically template  
c. We can implements as many interface -> but we only extend one class  
d. We cannot create object of the abstract class since abstract class has unimplmented method nad if we are creating object of such classes these classes cannot function properly on its own.  
  
  
a. Abstract : it contains abstract and non abstract methods  
b. Interface : it contains only abstract methods + default and static-> basically it is a contract that specifies a set of methods that a class must implement.  
c. Method implementation : in abstract class the methods can be implemented while others are left abstract with no implementation so the concrete class can and cannot give implementatiton  
i. But in interface the class which implements that interface needs to give the implementation for those methods  
d. Inheritance : a class can extend only one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces  
e. Variables : interface will have only final and static variables  
f. Method in interface are abstract  
g.  
h. In interface -> we need to override the methods  
i.

2. Output based Problem  
class Vehicle {  
public void move() {  
System.out.println("The vehicle is moving");  
}  
}  
class Car extends Vehicle {  
public void move() {  
System.out.println("The car is moving");  
}  
}  
  
// Case 1  
Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();  
vehicle.move();  
  
//Case 2  
Car car = new Car();  
car.move();  
  
  
//Case 3  
Car car2 = new Vehicle();  
car2.move();  
  
// Case 4  
Vehicle secondVehicle = new Car();  
secondVehicle.move();  
  
- Solution -  
○ Case 1 - The Vehicle is Moving  
○ Case 2 - The car is moving  
○ Case 3 - Class Cast Exception -> compile time -> we can also cast it to car type it will fix the exception but , run time it will throw an exception  
○ Case 4 - The car is moving.  
  
- Understanding Case 3 in deep ,  
○ ClassCastException - will be thrown in case No.3,  
○ ClassCastException is a runtime exception , means unchecked exception, and there is no need to add throws in constructor or method declaration.  
○ This exception occurs when we try to cast an object to a class , which the object is not an instance of  
○ Use instanceof --> operator to check the at the object can be casted to other class or not -> sometimes we are doing type casting that time always verify first with instance Of operation whether it is possible to type cast or not  
○ Child class object can be type casted to parent type -> means parent class can store the object of the child class  
  
String str = new String("hello world");  
  
System.out.println(str instanceof Object);  
  
Above mentioned code will give true

1. Example of Callable with Executor Service  
  
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;  
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;  
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;  
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;  
import java.util.concurrent.Future;  
public class Main3 {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
System.out.println("hello world");  
  
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100);  
Callable task1 = () -> {  
int sum=0;  
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {  
sum+=i;  
Thread.sleep(10);  
  
}  
return sum;  
};  
//submit -> callable -> Future  
Future<Integer> future1 = executorService.submit(task1);  
future1.get();  
//shutdown  
executorService.shutdown();;  
}  
}  
1.  
2. What happens when we call executor.submit method ?  
1. When we call executorSerrice.submit -> the task means runnable or callable will be added to the queue and then from the thread pool  
2. A thread will pick up a item from the queue  
3. Once task is executed by thread it will remove it from the Queue  
4. If the task that we have submitted to executorService is Callable means it will returns a value and with the help of futures we can check when it is finished but wieth Runnable the task will not return anything.  
5. If you want to wait for the task completion you have to use future.get()  
3. Examplef of Executor Service with Runnable ?  
1. Create Thread Pool  
2. Create Task object that is immutable object  
3. Crreate Runnable inside that perform all the task -> pass the task object as reference variable  
4. Submit the runnable to the executor service  
5. Shutdown the executor service
