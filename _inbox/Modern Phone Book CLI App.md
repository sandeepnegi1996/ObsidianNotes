How to Run 
------------
 `javac PhoneBook.java`
 `java PhoneBook`





####  Learning
```
//override the hashcode method

    //since the datastructure suchas arraylist works in serial fashio

    //but that is not the fast way of doing this

    //so there are some datastrucutre implementation of hashTable and these datastrucuter uses hashcode to

    //to distinguish the elements
```
