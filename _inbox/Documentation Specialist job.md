## Motivation
This thing comes in my mind because I was thinking what I really like and I like creating documentation and mostly written form or audio or video format any format is fine for me so why not find a job that can give me this thing 

### Jobs for documentation
1. Documentation Specialist
2. Testing 
3. Using a product and documenting it
