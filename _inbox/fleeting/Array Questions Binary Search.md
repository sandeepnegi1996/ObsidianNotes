# Binary Search 
[[450 DSA Cracker]]
1. most efficient searching algorithm
2. log(n)
3. works on sorted data 

## How it works 
1. We compare our element to the middle element
2. since the list is sorted, we know that right side of the middle will be larger to it
3. and last side will be smaller than that list 
4. if our element, is greater than the middle, we will choose the right side and now we will search in that space only
5. if our element is smaller than the middle element, we will choose the left side and now we will search in that space only ,
6. if our element matches the middle element, we will return the result
