1. Turn off notifications :) 
2. Special ringtone for most important people in their life 
3. Do not use cellphone, after 10PM 
4. Avoid carry phone in your pocket, that can help us to be more calm
5. Use some minimalist  app, I use that makes my screen black and only some apps are present on the homepage, other apps are present in second page where we need to scroll and find the app
6. Phantom cellphone syndrome : feeling of phone is buzzing even it is not.
