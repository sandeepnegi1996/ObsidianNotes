4. lazziness

##### solutions 
1. right solar system -> 
2. solar expert 
3. and right quality product 


#### disadvantage of on-grid solar systems 
1.  maintainence -> cleaning -> we want sprinkler system -> clean with chemical 
2. no power backup -> in on -grid power system 
	1. if power is out there will be no generation of electrivity, zero generation if there is power outage 
3. single phase inverter -> phase and neutral -> if there is voltage fluctuation there will be no generation of power 
4. weather dependency -> 
5. high initial cost 
6. carry forward unit 
	1. lets say 10Kw -> 40 unit -> 30 unit is being used at home -> 10 unit saved every month 0> 30 X 12 = 360
	2. there will be no money paid to you only it will reduce your bills.


#### problem with on-grid solar systems 
1. in on-grid the solar system will not work if there is no electricity for the safety of the electrician.
