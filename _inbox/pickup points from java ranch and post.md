**Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. (Fowler)**

**Debug only code - comments can lie.**

**If you have too many special cases, you are doing it wrong.**

**Get your data structures correct first, and the rest of the program will write itself.**

**Testing can show the presence of bugs, but not their absence.**

**The first step in fixing a broken program is getting it to fail repeatedly.**

**The fastest algorithm can frequently be replaced by one that is almost as fast and much easier to understand.**

**The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components of a computer system are those that aren't there.**

**Good judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement.**

**Don't use the computer to do things that can be done efficiently by hand.**

**[Thompson's Rule for first-time telescope makers] It is faster to make a four-inch mirror then a six-inch mirror than to make a six-inch mirror.**

**If you lie to the computer, it will get you.**

**Inside of every large program is a small program struggling to get out.**
