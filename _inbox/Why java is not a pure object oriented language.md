# 📑 Why java is not a pure object oriented language ?

- **🏷️Tags** : #java , #completed , #interview-prep

1. a pure object oriented language treats everything inside a program as objects.
2. it does not support primitive datatype such as int,char, float , bool etc

### Reasons java is not a pure object oriented programming language 
1. It supports primitive data type such as bye short , int,long, float double.

2. Static Keyword - with the use of static keyword, lets say if there is a method that is static -> it can be accessed with the help of the class and same goes for static fields those can be accessed with the help of the static keyword.
	1. This breaks the law of pure object oriented programming language where everything should be accessed via object and not the class.
3. Wrapper classes -> even if we create objects of wrapper classes such as Integer,Float,Boolean,Double etc and we try to perform some operation such as addition or subtraction under the hood it uses the concept of autoboxing and unboxing and primitive type is only used -> hence java is not pure oopl.
