## 4 Rs in Learning
1. Retreival
	1. Explain stuff or eloraborate the problem to your self or someone else but better you teach something which you know since for this we need some kind of active recall to understand that thing in deep since there some questions that may arise due to this :) 
2. Rearranging 
	1. Learn things in this order : ABCBACACB
	2. so that we can rearrange and link all the learning from one topic to learning in other topics this can basically help us become a better since we can apply some concepts from one learning to other domain that is what [[Thinking an Linking]] is all about 
	3. read how different companies are using a particular technology in their papers can we also use the same thing in our company and create a revolution
3. Repetition
	1. This is the key since with repetition only you will actually learn something
	2. think of walking , typing, running , eating more you repeat better you will become in these activities same thing happends in software developement as well :) 
4. Rest 
	1. sleep consolidates memory --> this is very much required
	2. simple rule --> do not drink coffee after 11 AM :)
