1. care less about what you think if you are working in mega corp since there are dictators on top of you which are implmenting the stuff so just focus on getting that shit done 
2. Switch Careers in 2 years -> your new organization will not focus on that you were productive in older organization or what values you have generated there , they just care about your next role that's it 
3. Usually companies do not promote their own employee -> because the same employees or colleagues will raise concern that this person is not good enough. 
4. but smart people will go out -> and try fixing stuff in an organisation, so no organisation does not want to fix stuff 
5. so you do your shit and then work on other stuff -
	1. internal promotion  is complex better to get outside your organisation.
	2. do not stress for performance reviews since it is designed so that we are not reaching that level.
	3. and if you wanted to get promotoed sit and make connection with folks that will actually promote you .
	4. you are not hired to do other thing, 
	5. care less about optimzed solution and work on some other areas. 
6.  its annoying but care less -> reduce stress and look for next job 
7. people on top care less -> and just focus on their work and make their manager look good , and these people make friends 
8. Top people are hired by connections. 
	1. get people to like you. 
	2. and optimised your piece.
9. Smart people are bored -> after 1 to 1.5 years 
10.
