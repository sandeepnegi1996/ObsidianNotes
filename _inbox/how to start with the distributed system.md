## Key Takeaways

## Overview



### Create a shop
1. only single chef is there in the pizza shop
2. optimize process and increase the throughput with the same resources  --> vertical scaling
3. preparing before hand at non peek hours --> this is the same concept which is shared by driviz for creation of the url in tiny url where he has already prepared the url and just  give the url to the user.


### Resilence
1. hire a backup chef --> and use that one required
2. keep backup and avoid single point of ffailure --> maste and slave in database
3. high more resources --> horizontal scaling



### 
1. we want to divide the requests to pizza and garlic bread chef
2. microservices --> architecture --> so we will scale those requests which are required


### Backup  --> Distributed System --> local system may be based on location 
1. if one shop is closed we can have one backup system and we can route the trafic to thius backup syste,

### Central Authroity --> load balancer
1. which will route the traffic

### Separating out concerns
1. Decoupling
2. Logging
3. Extensible
