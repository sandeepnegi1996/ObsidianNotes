##### Apply the Law of Straight Lines.
- Geometry concept : shortest path between two points is a straight line
- Similar way to reach Goals, we should take the shortest and most efficient path we should not waste our time on low priority tasks.

- Spending time on low priority tasks
- chatting with friends online, twittering , aimlessly surfing the internet.
- Jumping from one activity to another and not completing any of them.

Action Points :
	- What is the shortest route to achieve my objective ?
	- In this action taking me to the right direction
	
My Case : I spend time on youtube watching shorts and aimlessly looking for videos to waste my time instead i can do something fruitful learn about some technical concept in depth or network or share it to others.


##### Set Boundaries

##### Allow Yourself to Be Pulled Forward by Coincidences
- There is a guy who is waiting for a bus he talked to a person and then suddenly he knows that there is hiring going on in his company and you are also looking for a similar opening, you have applied and you got the job.

- We can increase a chances of coincidences working in our favor by increasing our inner harmony through meditation, yoga, tai chi, breathing exercise.

-  [[Attract Coincidence and Synchronicity]]

In my case also this thing happended quite number of times whatever i wanted somehow happened with me over time , some people calls it luck but i think it is just the desires i have and i have prepared myself for those and i reached there.
