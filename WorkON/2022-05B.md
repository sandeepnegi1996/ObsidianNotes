2. Q system : EMEA Q4
3. Application Name: `RBGEHS` on 17.05.2022 and `RBMDVISITS`

#### Customer support to add cost center in the template
```
Need one support – Due to recent CI integration, we have lost access to WorkOn template (cost center shared) which I have created,

[https://rb-wam.bosch.com/workon01/workflow02/secure/CreateTemplateIssue!default.jspa?pkey=RBGA-5071341](https://rb-wam.bosch.com/workon01/workflow02/secure/CreateTemplateIssue!default.jspa?pkey=RBGA-5071341)

[https://rb-wam.bosch.com/workon01/workflow02/secure/CreateTemplateIssue!default.jspa?pkey=RBGA-5097428](https://rb-wam.bosch.com/workon01/workflow02/secure/CreateTemplateIssue!default.jspa?pkey=RBGA-5097428)

Could you please add the below cost centers to the above two templates ?

-   652HWW
-   865913

```

- [x] are we legally authorised to do this. 
- [ ] follow garuranshi for the approval on the authorization --> pending

#### UI Changes required. 

for the admin page --> check remove the max-width from x-panel and x-panel-body 
also fix the table layout and td changes int eh code base and then create the war file 



4. 1.  The Admin page is left aligned – Expectation:  It should be center aligned
5.  The Form designer, though usable now – it is left aligned and occupies only 60% of the page width.  Expectation:  It should occupy 100% of the screen
6.  The Master data admin, again usable, but occupies only 60% width.  Expectation:  It should occupy 100% of the screen.
