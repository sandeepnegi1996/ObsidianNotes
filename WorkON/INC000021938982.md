## Problem
User is not able to access the workon Q system ,and roles are being assigned to the user.

User :   
Le Dinh Thu (SO/OPM12-VH) (LTD2HC)

- Role Name :   rb_workon_all_workon-support

## Solution
- May be roles are not synced to all databases in Q 
-  First i will check what are the roles assigned to this user in one Database and then all the other databases
-


select * from WORKON_IDM_USER_ROLE where ACCOUNT_ID='LTD2HC';


select * from WORKON_IDM_ROLES where ROLE_NAME=' rb_workon_all_workon-support';

## Results :
rb_workon_all_workon-support

ROLE ID =631 is assigned to the user

we need to do the sync of the materialized views so that the roles are synced to all the databases
