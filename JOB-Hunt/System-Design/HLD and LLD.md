## High Level Design (HLD)
- High Level Design
1. overall system design
2. bird eye view of the project
3. Architecture
4. hardware
5. networking 
6. software modules and components
7. User trasaction flow 
8. *Once we received the requirements we can start working on the HLD*
9. *Solution Architect will create HLD and then subject matters experts or desgners will create LLD*

- It descibes primary feattures that we will deliver
- we will not go closer to the implementation here.
- once all the internal and external stakeholders agreed on the deliverables then only we can move to LLD

- When the HLD is prepared , it is prepared during the analysis phase of SDLC
- [[SDLC]]
	- Analysis
	- Design
	- Developing
	- Testing Support

- Solution Architect is the owner of HLD
