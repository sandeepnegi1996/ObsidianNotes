# What is hibernate



## How does JPA/Hibernate Work?
- Database : stored tables and relations 
- Java : it works on objects 
- We want to store objects to database ans viceversa
- This mapping is called as Object Relational Mapping.
- That's why Hibernate is also called as ORM Framework


## How JPA works ?
- it maps application classes to tables in database
- **Entity Manager** : manage entitites and interactions with the database
- **JPQL** : we can write Query 
- **Criteria API**



## JPA vs Hibernate
- Hibernate --> framework , JPA --> API (Specification)
