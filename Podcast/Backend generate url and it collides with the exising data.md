# Backend generate url and it collides with the exising data


- Collision happens and user is waiting response
- User experience will be bad
- What we can do to avoid to the collision



- one more service is there which will create the unique url in the backend and what i will do when the user comes and we will take the url from the unique database and from there i will take and give it to the user , 

- once the url is used we will remove the entry from the database
