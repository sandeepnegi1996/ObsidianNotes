# Why java is platform independent
#java 
#concept



1. platform independent means: when java code is compiled it produces byte code and that byte code can be run on all the OS, that's why we call java platform independent
2. Compiler : it coverts the source code (human readable) to a format that can be understood by machines


## How java code is compiled
1. javac (java compiler) , will compile the `.java` file
2. it produces `.class` which is callled as byte code
3. `java classname`  we are telling JVM to run this byte code


## Java is platform-independent but JVM is platform dependent

1. JDK consists of JVM and JDK is different for differnt OS, thats why JVM is also different for different Os
2. so whatever byte code we have can be run by any JVM on any Machine(windows, linux, mac)
3. That is what providing the portability to java
