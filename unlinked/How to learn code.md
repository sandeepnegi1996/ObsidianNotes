## Key Takeaways
1. Brain works on neuron connections
2. Connections improves by repeating things
3. Repeat things and improve the existing connections
4. Build new connections 
5. Think how coding is implemented and solving real world problems
6. Do not memorize , repeat and repeat it untill you understood how it works




1. How brain works
	1. neurons --> send informatons
	2. when we learn basically we are creating connections between our neurons 
	3. more connections better understanding
	4. smarter --> more connections 
	5. better connections 


2. Intially connections in brain is weak when we learn something
3. Make connections stronger
	1. do something again and again
	2. it will make the connections stronger and thus we will get better into that
	3. means if i wants to learn how to solve the coding problems, what i need to do is solve more questions , do it every single day
	4. *Code Everyday*
	5. Extracts information from brain again and again

4. So to learn to code *Code Everyday*
5. Do not memorize since memorizaton put things into temporary memory
6. we wants to create permanent memoty
7. *Live alone and work on yourself*


3. **Build Stuff**
4. *Thing  what i am coding how it is applicable to real life*
5. *Excited about problems and solve those problems*
