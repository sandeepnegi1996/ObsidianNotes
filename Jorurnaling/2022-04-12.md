Today it was a normal day like a usual day, but i woke up little late since i slept really late so i really need to fix it maximum I should slept by the time it is 11 PM this will solve most of the issues where i should wake up little early and start working as soon as possible.

## Interview 
- So Today there was an interview planned and i thought it was some other interview but looks like i was interviewing for the TCS only , this can be problematic since HR can ask me directly why did you do that.
- In that case i will be truthful that i was applying for so many firms and i lost to keep the track of the companies and this is totally my fault and I am really sorry if i have voilated any of the company policies


## Work
1. Today it looks like a rock during my work since i have solved the tickets really fast and it was really cool


## Confidence due to interviews 
- Today I felt like my confidence is building due to interviews
- This is because my interviews are going good and i was able to answer most of the Questions asked in the java world
- I am nailing it and i need to build upon it and take this confidence to the next level.


## Maximum Salary Jump 20 LPA
- I am thinking of making a salary jump to 20 LPA since this is it man, this is really helping me to perform at work and also this interview process is really helping me to build my tech skills
- Interview process combined with obsidian is a lethal combination what ever the questions were asked i am going to document all of them prepare a knowledge base that will serve me in the future 
- Update the knowledge base as i work, As i will work i will also keep improving my knowledge base since this is the only way to learn and grow.


## Focus on Active income
- Once there is a point my active income is good and i am able to perform good at work, I will also look for side gigs and parallel sources of income such as creating and selling PDF.
