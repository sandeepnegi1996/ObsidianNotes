### Journaling 
Today was a fine day I came back to Bangalore after around 2.5 years and booked one PG completed all the setting went to DMart to buy some stuff. Now for the next few years I wanted to practice frugality and build huge corpus so that I can reinvest that money and live my dream life since I wanted to financially free and the key to achieve that is buy following frugal habits and working on the things I love


- Being Frugal is not just saving money it means I wanted to spend my time and energy on things I love and this is what is the true definition of being frugal.
- I know people will call me maheen or any other name but I will put my time and energy only on the stuff that I truly wanted in my life since there are so many things are there but I wanted to invest my time only on few things 

- I wanted to invest my time on learning, tech, learning frugality and savings , I wanted to invest time on writing such as blogposts or just journaling, I wanted to invest my time on building body and functional physique I wanted to invest my time in meeting people in technical and people who are interested in hiking and trekking.
