Today was a good day , i have finished my tasks such as finding the root cause of why the download is not working and also created the Pull request for tasks.

Completed my leg workout today and eaten a really good meal, later in the day we went to eat outside that was the  a fine decision but smoking cigaratte was not the correct decision to fix, this i need to learn [[how to say NO to people]]

I started using the tool called as obsidian i really love this tool since i can do my journaling with this tool and i can take my personal notes in this tool + i can also put this in git to take it with me in the next company in that sense i will have the complete list.


I heard about one theory today that is Time is like a elastic , [[Time Elasticity]]

Today i have also received one call from TCS for an interview on 9th i need to plan for this and start preparing hard for this.

I have also learned the concept of [[Thinking an Linking]]

I have improved my github profile

### Improvement Needed
-  I need to spend more time with myself and with my family and avoid contact with others
-  I like speaking to old friends so i should give them a call more often
