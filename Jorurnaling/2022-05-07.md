## Daily Review  
- so many interviews today, first interview in the morning i was not able to solve even single problem out of two felt like a loser am i really a loser because there are so many things i am way better than other i don;t know may be i should relate my self to that definition of loser

[[what is the definition of a loser]]

- later second interview it went pretty well i was able to answer most of the questions and i was fun and also there are some stuff that i need to  work on

- Third interview i was not able to completely solve one questions but apart from that i was able to answer other questions, i think i was better on those concepts then others and i need to focus more on java other wise it will be just waste of time if i don;t know all the concepts java, i want to become a java geeks
