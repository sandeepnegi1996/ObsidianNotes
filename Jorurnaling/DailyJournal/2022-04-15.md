- I have not written anything for the past 2 days since i went to dehradun to attend manish bhatt sister marriage and it was fun, i went with naman and rahul.
- After attending the sangeet we next day we went to a place called as **shikhar fall** where we have enjoyed the waterfall and love the scenery i love the hiking part there i have also talked to few women and i have asked them if they wanted to go below the water fall but they said it is too deep for them so i said ok then go and try from that end , any how it was fun.

## Bhatt sister marriage 
- We have enjoyed the snacks there and it was fun to eat all those snacks and then going to another marriage and then eating more food there , it was really cool.


## Things i wanted to change
- I did not liked my behvaior there of smoking and driking this is not the part of my best life and this basically does not contribute to my best life, so from now on i have decided i have **Quit DSG** atleast till i not build my sister's home since it is my duty to help them build their dream home.


## Things i don't like about Naman
- Even though i am taking care of all of his expenses he is asking me again and again to smoke a cigrrate this is not the right behavior , from now on i will avoid further interaction and travelling with this type of guy, i would have went to meet my friends like Dhruv there i would have rarely spend 2-3k only and here i spend 4-5k on last trip and this time also 3-4k so this is not worth it and plus he is not adding any value to my life, so i beleive i need to cut this node and remove from my life, from now on i will only meet him in the gym and after wards i will not meet him.

## Interaction with Driviz
- Today Driviz called me and asked i wanted to work on Golang or not i said yes why not i can learn it , he has referred me to a team who is working on payment thing and they said if a guy is there who knows java and can easily upskill we are happy to hire him
- We have discussed so many things and it was unebeliveable to understand how much he knows and all the concept that he has shared with him, i wanted to understand what should i learn next but now i got the idea what will be my next step in the learning and how i can achieve the best results. 
- for the next 15 days i will just focus on the skills shared by him and try to master those.
