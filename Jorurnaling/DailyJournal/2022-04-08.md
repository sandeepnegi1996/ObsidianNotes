## Mistakes
- I am not actively looking for a job whereas i should utilize these 60 days work hard on the technical skills and get atleast 4-5 job offers. For that i need to do two things first is Competitive coding , and second is java and spring boot microservices.

## Career Development
- I did not learned any new concept or demystify the existing concept. I need to work there and pick one concept and code around that and complete it. 
- Currently I need to focus more on the spring boot microservices and how the configuration is done of the eureka server , 

## Personal Development
- Writing : Journaling 
- I need to plan meals with my family i am lacking here, since i am waking up late in the morning, I need to sleep early for that i need to switch off my phone and go to bed at 10:00 PM
