## Future You
1. Moviing towards my future self , DCG followed , no PMO is followed + i am also learning and spending time with my family

## Evening  thoughts 
Protip: you have to aware of people like sonali who will not motivate you to achive something and neither share some information so that you can become better version of yourself but they also scare you so you don't crack the interview, this is ridicolous all my friends are motivating me to crack the interview she is saying DS and algo and system design questions will come, but none of the friends told me that they are asking system desing questions , so this is ridicously, guys be aware of these kind of people just the negativity out from your system every single day.

Remove people from contact, from facebook , from whatsapp who doesn't aspire to become the better version of your self :) 

Beleive me this is going to help you a lot in the long run, surround your self with people like dhruv, driviz, dhani ram , manish who are motivating your to become better version of your self :)
