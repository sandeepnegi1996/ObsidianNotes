### Morning thoughts
- so I have recently shifted my place and and now I have my own room and private space and frankly speaking it is quite good now I am back to writing and also feeling like I have time for myself.
- I am planning everything now like meals and my workouts , I have started going to the gym and gym is kind of shady but since I am starting as a beginner it will be fine also it is near to my home so it will have least resistance even If it rains I can go there and do my thing.
- I wanted to see how far I can take my body, basically wanted to be the strongest in my bloodline so that everyone can talk about me.

## Gratitude
- I am full of gratitude that I have friend like aman around me he has paid 10k for me without even a flinch and so do amit once but If I asked anyone else for the same they wouldn't have done it.

### Journaling 
1. what went well 
	1. able to find the root cause and fix the bug pretty fast 
	2. helped avinash to connect with perf team guy ankush
	3. received good feedback from ayas on the technical side
2. what didn't well 
	1. did not received good feedback on the behavioral side, that is sometimes I cross boundaries and people can feel like challenged or I am taking any of their credit but that was never my intention
	2. I slept little late around 10:30 and that too while using the phone 
3. How we can improve 
	1. Need to check that I only provide input on my user stories and I have any query I should rather ask the developer or the code personally and not in the scrum update since that is a raeally short meeting .
	2. switchoff and put the phone in the almirah by 9 , in this way if I need any stimulus I will be taking the old route of reading the books to get the stimulus 
	3.
