## Daily Review  
- for the past two days i am not following no PMO and DCG felt bad for myself but i made a choice from today this will not happen everytime i will feel like not working what i will do take a break and go for a walk or call a friend
- Sleep early so that there will be no thoughts of PMO
- I also did not completed the planning and  i think that is the reason somehow my progress was not tracked
