- Hi Amit,

- This is my way of expressing gratitude towards our friendship, 

I really do not remember the first day we have met but I had memories from our 11th class that you used to be a `bakchod` guy , who is funny , resilient and really you do not have like any kind of filter while you are speaking , what ever comes to your mouth you just speak it out , and that is kind of cool to me, since I was kind of introvert and was not that much expressive about my emotions and feelings , So I really admire your attitude at that time I know most of the people will not like it because but you can't make everyone happy right 

- I remember a day when you have said **trimurti** and there were three of our teacher who were standing , kiran sathi was there, and physics() and Maths (Anuradha) all three were there that is amazing and bold at the same time saying that in front of all the three.

- I have learned from you that you can't make everyone happy, and you do not have to be a `YES MAN` to be good friend.

- I remember the time when we used to go to Sudhir for our chemistry classes and that was really fun, because of the hand injury you have suffered a lot but still you have managed to score decent marks
- you were going to the tuitions riding your bicycle with one hand, at that time I was not serious and I do not have that much empathy but when I look back now , I think that was a fucking brave and stupid move at the same.

- Chalo ab chaltein hain kota, so after 12 we both have decided that we will go to kota for the preparation of JEE and that time. There we both used to go for our classes during day time in scorching heat and then study their come back home and go for a dinner , that time was really really tough and I want to admit that time I was thinking of competing against you also I don't know why I started competing with you since there are lakhs of students applying for the exam so there was no benefit of competing with you.

- I used to study by closing the lights and then study using just the lamp. I was just making my eyes hurt and sometimes I even did not wake you up in the morning or before classes since I was jealous because you know that you are smart kid right, and It was difficult for me to compete with you instead of taking help from you I was not using the correct route. I think the culprit here is our education system that made us think that there can be just one person who can come first in class, but in reality there are so many things where we can rise and shine live happily.

- you have bought that canvas micromax phone and believe me bro itni HD me kabhi porn nhi dekhi thi maine, aur bhai sahi btaun na abhi tak yaad hai woh wali porn , Ohhhhhhh bhaiiiiii it was amazing , best porn of my life on that cellphone , Thank you bro for that. 

- one thing I have observed about you is that, there are times, when you have literally like wasted so much time, but still when you switch your gears you will go like a rocket and you will literally beat anyone out there.

- Then comes the beautiful part when we have joined the college, LPU, bhai sahi btaun na toh meri himmat nhi hoti khud kae liye college search krna but bhai tere sath we went to haridwar and done all the formalities **just because of you I am living a really good life now and my whole family is really really happy**  !! Thank you bro for that movement.

- I remember the first day you have already reached the college and then I came , you have shown me hostle and kahn hume thukna hai after doing brush, hahah  I used to follow that sometime and it was fun.

- In college it was great but we were not in the same class, I wish we could be in the same class, but that did not happen, any how. 

- We used to go together for lunch and you were like bored of that lunch but I was like chalo khane chaltein hamesha aur tu aur dhruv marte rehte the meri maaza ata tha par yaar ek baar dubara waise hi karna hai bhai college jake, mess mae khana khana hai and rice bown lena hai, aur running kae liye jana hai jisme I will be never be able to beat you in that 100m shuttle, even thought I was pushing 120% I still not able to beat even a single time, that just burst it out and rana throws some really long steps and beats me.

- We used to go to phagwara drink lassi and hamesha mae tujhe leke jaata tha ghumne kae liye ya phir college kae bahr, aur bhai tu chicken bhi nhi khata tha, but after someitme you were like half toh kha hi lunga,

- Aur bhai woh din yaad hai jab , mistri ki gaand lag wa di thi tune , gaurd sae bakchodi karke, doctors were like, we are not satisfied with the reading this much amount of alcohol how is it even possible someone can drink this much

- aur bhai tumhara pyar woh DS wali teacher sala Sagar bda hi MC insaan tha bhai ek dum bhai ek din dikha mujhe toh teacher kae sath baith rakha after classes bakchodi pel rha thaa,
aur bhai woh pta hai tereko jab uska laptop tuta hua aya tha amazon sae bhai woh news mae chala gya tha  launda uski bakaida video hai hahahaahaha , ohhh bhai maza aa gya woh video dekh kae.

- Aur bhai thanks for helping me make good life long friends like, dhruv , driviz, and vikas, bhai tere wajah sae hi mai in laundo sae mil paya and right now I have really cool relationship with them.

- aur bhai maine tumhare sath bilkul bhi acha nhi kiya pachtawa , regret hamesha sa rahega us baat ka, when both of you were placed, I did not even went to meet dhruv, he called me nearly 50 times, how can someone do this kind of stuff man, chutiya ho gya tha bhai mai tutt sa gya tha bhai us samay when both of my friends were placed and were leaving the college also and I was having a backlog and not being able to sit in the placements, I really felt like a left out, atleast I have met you when you have left I can never forget that day, 

- Then comes to next phase, job phase I also got intersnship and completed that but they give 6 months come to banglore , with just 15k out of which spend most of them in PG and food, and was searching job like crazy that time I really hit my bottom bro, that's why not able to meet you I was thinking I did not achived anything how I will face you. I was travelling for 3-4 hrs and giving interviews but no response was coming from any job portal I was devasted but you came to meet me thank you bro for meeting me at that point of time, you have shown me what is a true friendship, in true friendship you be with someone in thier hardships and when they are not in their best shape. I can neven forget that time, even tough I was not taking to you , but I used to tell my friends and family that amit is working in Postman, bhai gaaand phaad company hai sab jagah faila toh deta hi hun mai :) 

- And thank you for coming to noida , it was one of the best moment of my life with my friends, :) 
  
  
  THANK YOU BRO , FOR BEING SUCH A TRUE FRIEND :)  !!!
